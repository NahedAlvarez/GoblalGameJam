Now, it's your job to find your way through a maze that contains all the pieces of your broken world with which you'll build the ultimate symbol of wisdom and power: a burger.

# About
After the GameJam theme was announced Erin and Brennan decided to join the small beginner’s team. They were drawn to the team’s enthusiasm, talent, and positive energy, and knew they could make a big impact on the team. Within the next few minutes, brainstorming began. The team met at the cafeteria and after getting some snacks they sat down to brainstorm what came to mind when they heard the word "repair". 

The team is largely bilingual, and the Colombian students were gracious enough to brainstorm in English. When one team member associated the word ‘broken’ with repair, another teammate misheard, and repeated in confusion, ‘Burger?’ After many laughs and jokes, a lot of chatter, excitement and arduous thinking, they returned to the idea of a burger, but not any burger. Instead, they created a magical godly-like burger on which the whole of the Universe depends.

The team returned to their work station and started to plan out both the game mechanics and the storyline. They separated into two teams that would later come together to start working on what we now know as, The Holy Burger.

He who understands the burger, understands the universe. The critical question remains: Do you understand the burger?
